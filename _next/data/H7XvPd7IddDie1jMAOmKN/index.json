Add your own logo and picture there.\n\n### Step 3: Add the blog\n\nCreate a new file under the **\\_posts** directory. Let's assume the new blog files name is **sample-blog.md**\n\nBe careful about the name because it will be the url (path) for your blog.\n\nEvery blog has a top section where you can specify some meta data about that blog\n\n```js\n---\ntitle: \"My Sample blog\"\ndescription: \"This is the description for the blog\"\nbanner: \"/images/sample-blog.jpeg\"\ntags: [\"NextJS\"]\ndate: 1 January 2022\n---\n```\n\nThese are pretty self explanatory.\n\n### Step 4: Add an image for the blog\n\nThis is optional. But this adds some value to the project.\nYou can go to the public folder of your project and add an image with the same name **sample-blog.jpeg** and refer it inside the **sample-blog.md** file.\n\nThat's it!\n\n### Run the project to verify\n\nIf you want to test the project locally\n\n```sh\nyarn dev\n```\n\nand go to **http://localhost:3000/sample-blog** to see the fruits of your labor!\n\n## Further Reading\n\nTo read more about how the different parts were built refer to these articles.\n\n- [Analytics](https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev/blog/add-google-analytics-to-nextjs)\n- [SiteMap](https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev/blog/create-sitemap-in-nextjs)\n- [SEO](https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev/blog/improve-seo-in-nextjs)\n- [Syntax Highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbWG4iYeJLQ&t=125s)\n- [Typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZZ5uwOkrAA)\n- [Favicon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIJ5ZLG_gg0)\n\n### Technologies Used\n\n- NextJS\n- Tailwind CSS\n- Typescript\n- Markdown\n- Syntax Highlighter\n\n### Features\n\n- Showing blog posts by parsing markdown\n- Syntax highlight with PrismJS\n- Google analytics Integration\n- SEO setup\n- Tailwind typography integration\n- Social media preview for blogs\n- Dark mode support with next-themes\n- Type checking TypeScript\n- Linter with ESLint\n- Code Formatter with Prettier\n\n### Github Repo\n\nhttps://github.com/Mohammad-Faisal/nextjs-tailwindcss-beautiful-blog-template\n\n### Demo:\n\nhttps://nextjs-tailwindcss-beautiful-blog-template-6bhlgxk4v.vercel.app/sample-blog\n","data":{"title":"My Sample blog","description":"This is the description for the blog","banner":"/images/sample-blog.jpeg","tags":["NextJS"],"date":"1 January 2022"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
